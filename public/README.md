# Public Directory - Generated Files

This directory contains **auto-generated files** that should **not be manually edited**.

## 📄 index.html

**Status:** ✅ Gitignored (see root `.gitignore` line 92)

The `index.html` file is the main application file, generated by:
```bash
python3 src/event_manager.py generate
```

### Why is it gitignored?

Previously, `index.html` was tracked by git, causing file conflicts when:
- Multiple developers worked on different branches
- CI workflows automatically updated the file
- Merges required resolving large HTML diffs

**Solution:** The file is now gitignored and generated fresh on each CI run.

### How to regenerate locally

After cloning the repository or pulling changes:

```bash
# Quick method
./scripts/regenerate_html.sh

# Manual method
python3 src/event_manager.py dependencies fetch
python3 src/event_manager.py generate
```

### For developers

**DO:**
- ✅ Edit source files: `assets/css/*.css`, `assets/js/*.js`, `assets/html/*.html`
- ✅ Run `generate` command to rebuild `index.html`
- ✅ Test your changes locally

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Manually edit `index.html` (changes will be lost)
- ❌ Try to commit `index.html` (git will ignore it)
- ❌ Worry about merge conflicts with `index.html` (no longer tracked)

### CI/CD Behavior

On every push to `main`:
1. ✅ CI fetches dependencies
2. ✅ CI generates fresh `index.html`
3. ✅ CI uploads to GitHub Pages
4. ❌ CI does NOT commit `index.html` to git

This ensures:
- No file conflicts between branches
- Always fresh, up-to-date HTML in production
- Source files remain the single source of truth
